# Judd (1998) Python Code Repository

This repository contains Python implementations of the methods and algorithms discussed in the seminal work of Kenneth L. Judd (1998). The repository is organized into three parts, mimicking the structure presented in the book.

## Structure

The repository is divided into three main sections:
  

1. **Part 1: Basics Methods in Numerical Analysis**
   - This part focuses on basic methods for solving functional equations that frequently appear in economic models, such as fixed point iteration, optimization, interpolation, and quadrature methods.
   

2. **Part 2: Solving Functional Equations**
   - The section focuses on numerical methods for solving functional problems, such as in an optimal control problem and shows numerical dynamic programming.

3. **Part 3: Applications**
   - The section applies the numerical methods and techniques from Parts 1 and Part 2 to solve practical economic models, including growth models, game theory, and econometrics.
   

## Purpose

The files in this repository are intended to provide Python code that corresponds to the algorithms and methods taught in Judd (1998). Each section includes scripts and notebooks that:

- Implement the numerical methods discussed in the book.
- Provide example problems and their solutions.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/judd1998-python.git

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- jupyter (if using Jupyter notebooks)

You can install these packages using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter
```
